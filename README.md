# nurmi.dev

My [personal website](https://nurvel.github.io) built with React + Vite and hosted with GitHub Pages.

## Get started 

Run locally with `npm start` (alias for `vite`) and open the URL printed in the terminal.

Create a production build with `npm run build`. Preview the generated site with `npm run preview`. Deploy with GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy` (uses `gh-pages` under the hood) which publishes the `dist/` output to the `gh-pages` branch.
